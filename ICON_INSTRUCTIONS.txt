# App Icon Instructions

You need to create 2 simple icon files and put them in the /static folder:

1. icon-192.png (192x192 pixels)
2. icon-512.png (512x512 pixels)

## Quick Way to Make Icons:
1. Go to https://favicon.io/favicon-generator/
2. Choose:
   - Text: 🏄 (or just "SJ")
   - Background: #10b981 (green)
   - Font: Bold
3. Generate and download
4. Rename the 192x192 and 512x512 files
5. Put them in the /static folder

OR

Use Canva/Photoshop to make a simple square with:
- Background: Dark blue (#0f172a) or Green (#10b981)
- Text: "SURF JUDGE" or just a wave emoji 🌊
- Export as PNG at 512x512 and 192x192

The app will work without icons, but they make it look professional on your phone's home screen!
